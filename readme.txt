Lyrics


The CCLI no. within the file is the one used for reporting (the one used included in the filename is only for the purpose of preventing name conflicts)

Limitations
1) Difficult to parse certain lyrics from websites (how long a line should be and where to break etc?)
2) Checked with powerpoint 2013 and above, not sure whether older powerpoints will work
3) Powerpoint with video background will not be smooth when jumping slides (even with macro)
