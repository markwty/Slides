Where would I run
But to the throne of mercy
Where would I kneel

But at this cross of grace
How great the love
How strong the hand that holds us
Beautiful so beautiful

So here I bow to lift You high
Jesus be glorified
In all things for all my life
I am Yours forever Yours

There is a King
Who bore the scars of healing
There is a Son who came in grace and truth

How great the love
That carries us to kindness
Wonderful You’re wonderful

God here and now be lifted high
Right here and now be glorified
God of Heaven and Earth
God who brought me back to life
I am Yours forever Yours
