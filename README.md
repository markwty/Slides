Macros to allow smooth video background in powerpoint except when jumping of slides<br>
Automated extraction (web scraping) and reporting of lyrics from CCLI songselect broke due to new interface<br>
Extraction of lyrics from other websites (Lyrics, LyricsOnDemand, WorshipTogether, AZLyrics, Musixmatch) is legacy<br>
<br>
## Format of song file<br>
Title<br>
Author (if empty, leave an empty line here)<br>
CCLI no (if empty, leave an empty line here)<br>
<br>
CCLI (if empty, leave an empty line here)<br>
<br>
Lyrics<br>
<br>
<br>
## Known limitations<br>
1) Difficult to parse certain lyrics from websites (how long a line should be and where to break etc)<br>
2) Checked with powerpoint 2013 and above, not sure whether older powerpoints will work<br>
3) Powerpoint with video background will not be smooth when jumping slides (even with macro)<br>
